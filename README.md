Project-2 by Mick Roth

Summary: This is a react project using ReactMapGL and Mapbox. The app renders the trees of NYC using the NYC Opendata API. 
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/pi5s-9p35

The user can filter the results by boro, zipcode, tree species, and status of the tree. The map automatically moves to the destination in question.

Technologies Used: React, HTML and CSS.

Scalability: Proposed updates include 
1) Markers that are scalable to the viewport of the map zoom size. 
2) General search bar that will search all available data. Useful if someone wants to enter a street name, for example.
3) Select list of neighborhoods by names.
